 1) Something doesn't show up: Did you use addSubnode(node)?
 
 2) Need to add a UIView Object? Refer to HATextField.swift
 
 3) Use height values greater than 50. At least 100. Sometimes views are hidden behind navigationbar
    Even if  navigationController?.navigationBarHidden = true and it still shows
    Use -
        newAlbumVC.edgesForExtendedLayout = .None
        newAlbumVC.extendedLayoutIncludesOpaqueBars = true
 
 4) Did you set delegate and datasources?
 
 5) UIView.animateWithDuration returns to fast.
    Is the view layerBacked? That will use layers instead of views
    Are you using "alpha" instead of "hidden" propperty?
