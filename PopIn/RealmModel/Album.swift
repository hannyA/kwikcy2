/*
 *  What we will store in persistence:
 *  
 *  1) The users albums, we can moitor the time on ourselves and have them deleted... 
 *          Maybe query the databse for updates, in case the internal clock changes
 * 
 *      These things will/can change, so do we store them?
 
 *  2) Friends albums?
 *  3) Users friends, excluding the photos?, because the user does chagne them, as well as usernames?
 *  4)
